# Automatic Sanitary Napkin Dispenser with Blynk App

## 📌 Project Overview
This project presents the design and development of an **Automatic Sanitary Napkin Dispenser** integrated with the **Blynk IoT app**.  
The aim is to create a **hygienic, contactless, and IoT-enabled solution** that ensures easy access to sanitary napkins in schools, colleges, offices, and public places.  

The system dispenses a napkin automatically when a user places their hand near the sensor, while the Blynk app allows real-time monitoring of the stock level.

## ⚙️ Components Used
- **Microcontroller**: NodeMCU (ESP8266) / ESP32 / Arduino UNO (depending on choice)  
- **IR Sensor**: For detecting hand presence  
- **Motor/Servo**: For dispensing napkins  
- **Relay Module**: To control motor mechanism  
- **Blynk App**: IoT-based mobile app for monitoring  
- **Power Supply**: 5V/12V depending on motor and microcontroller

## 🚀 Working Principle
1. The **IR sensor** detects the presence of a hand near the dispenser.  
2. The **microcontroller** processes the signal and triggers the motor.  
3. One sanitary napkin is dispensed.  
4. The **Blynk App** updates the count of napkins and shows availability.  
5. When stock is low, a notification can be sent via Blynk.
